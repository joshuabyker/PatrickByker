                    <br>
                    I hope that this message finds you well, and that you enjoyed a peaceful holiday season. As we begin 2020, I am asking for your help in my campaign for the Durham County Board of Commissioners.
                During my 25 years in Durham, it has been a great privilege to work with you and get to know you as friends and colleagues. I realize this election will be a difficult undertaking, so I need your help. 
                Given the current political climate in Durham, I am staking myself out as a moderate Democrat standing in frony of a tidal wave of what is labeled "progressive" in Durham these days.

                    The fact that our community lost over $150 million on the light rail project, and this egregious loss is rarely if ever discussed in Durham. This only exemplifies the "echo chamber" currently in place- in fact, I have not seen the loss referred to in ANY questionaires so far. That 150 million dollars did not come from the pockets of GoTriangle; it belonged to Durham County tax payers like you and I. My experience demonstrates a record of on-time and on-or-under budget performance as:

                        <li>Former Chair, Capital Program Advisory Committee</li>
                        <li>Former Chair, Durham Convention Center Authority</li>
                        <li>Former Secretary, Durham Crime Cabinet</li>
                        <li>Former Treasurer, DIscover Durham with oversight of Durham 150 celebration</li>
                        <li>Current Vice Chair, DIscover Durham (Tourism Development Authority)</li>

                    I recall City Council member Howard Clement and County Commissioner Becky Heron supporting my applications to serve on DATA and the Convention Center Authority respectively, and they taught me to treat taxpayer dollars like my own. In addition, I have spent 25 years in my professional career working to expand
